Don't think about what to write just let it happen. Write whatever comes to mind. No one else needs to read it, so don't strive for perfection in grammar or spelling.Just let your thoughts flow on paper — or computer screen. Once you're done, you can toss out what you wrote or save it to reflect on later.Listening to or playing music is a good stress reliever because it can provide a mental distraction, reduce muscle tension and decrease stress hormones. Crank up the volume and let your mind be absorbed by the music.If music isn't one of your interests, turn your attention to another hobby you enjoy, such as gardening, sewing, sketching anything that requires you to focus on what you're doing rather than what you think you should be doing.If new stressors are challenging your ability to cope or if self-care measures just aren't relieving your stress, you may need to look for reinforcements in the form of therapy or counseling. Therapy also may be a good idea if you feel overwhelmed or trapped, if you worry excessively, or if you have trouble carrying out daily routines or meeting responsibilities at work, home or school.
Professional counselors or therapists can help you identify sources of your stress and learn new coping tools.
